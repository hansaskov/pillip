    "Test": " The image shows a close-up of a string of lights that look like glowing pumpkins or possibly some kind of spherical lamps. These lights are illuminated and emit a warm, yellowish-orange light. There is also the shadow of a hand holding these lights on the surface beneath them, suggesting that they are being held by someone out of frame. The focus is on the string of lights, which creates a soft glow against the darker background."
