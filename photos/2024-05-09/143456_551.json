    "Test": " In the image, you can see a hand holding what appears to be an LED light bulb or some type of glowing object. The bulb is not in use at the moment, so it's not emitting any light but has a pattern that suggests it might be designed to resemble a jellyfish or another type of sea creature when lit up. The background is blurred and doesn't provide much information about the setting."
