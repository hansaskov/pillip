    "Test": " The picture shows a hand holding a light bulb with an unusual shape, which appears to be designed in a way that may resemble a cloud or a soft, flowing object. This is likely a LED bulb designed for decorative purposes, as its irregular shape is not typical for standard light bulbs meant for functional use. The design might be intended to serve as an ambient light source with a visually appealing and organic look."

    "Test": " The picture shows a LED light bulb that appears to be designed for use with an LED strip, possibly for creating decorative patterns or illuminating objects in a home. It's not turned on at the moment, but when activated, it would emit a bright, colorful glow that could change colors if it's part of a flexible RGB LED strip."
