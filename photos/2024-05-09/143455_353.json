    "Test": " The picture shows a modern light fixture with an intricate design. It appears to be made up of multiple intertwined metal rods or tubes that create a three-dimensional sculpture that glows from within, possibly emitting light. The design is quite organic and resembles the form of a flower or a star. This type of lighting can serve as both an artistic statement and a functional fixture for providing illumination."
