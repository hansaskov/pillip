    "Test": " The image shows a light fixture that appears to be made up of numerous small, cylindrical lights connected in a radial pattern. This design gives the impression of an organic or flower-like shape at the center, surrounded by smaller lights that spread out from the core like petals. The lights are illuminated and cast a soft glow on the surrounding area, which is darkened to highlight the light fixture as the focal point of the image."
