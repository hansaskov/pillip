    "Test": " The image shows a modern pendant light. It is designed with an intricate pattern that gives it a unique and decorative appearance, possibly using paper or other materials to create the design elements. The light fixture has multiple layers that branch out from a central point, creating a kind of organic-looking structure that would provide ample illumination for the area below it. It's not currently lit in this image, which is why the details are subtle."
