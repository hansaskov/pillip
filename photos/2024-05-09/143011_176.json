    "Test": " The picture shows an artistic light fixture that resembles a cluster of white paper lanterns. The lanterns appear to be intricately folded or cut, creating a complex and visually interesting pattern. This type of lighting is often used for its unique design and the way it diffuses light throughout the space in which it's placed."
