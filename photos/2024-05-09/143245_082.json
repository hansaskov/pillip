    "Test": " The image shows a ceiling light that appears to be designed with an organic or flower-like shape. It has several layers of what looks like paper or fabric, possibly illuminated from within by LED lights, creating a warm and inviting ambiance. The design is quite intricate, with multiple points and curves that give it an abstract yet natural appearance."
