    "Test": " The image shows a decorative lighting fixture, which appears to be a modern and artistic piece. It consists of numerous paper-like elements that are arranged in a symmetrical pattern around a central void or hole. This kind of sculptural lighting is often used as an accent piece for interior design to add visual interest and ambient lighting."
