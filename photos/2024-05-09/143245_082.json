    "Test": " The image shows a modern lighting fixture that resembles an abstract, artistic piece. It consists of multiple layers or circles that create a concentric pattern around a central void, giving it the appearance of a flower or a sunburst. The design is sleek and contemporary, featuring what looks like paper or thin metal sheets in white or light-colored tones. This type of lighting fixture would typically be used for decorative purposes in modern interior spaces to create an interesting visual effect and provide ambient lighting."
