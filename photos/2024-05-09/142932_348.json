    "Test": " The picture shows a modern pendant light fixture. It appears to be designed with an organic shape, possibly resembling a flower or a circular pattern of petals, which creates an interesting visual effect when lit up. The light fixture seems to have multiple layers and could feature LED lights that would shine through the gaps in the structure, providing both ambient and accent lighting for the space it is placed in."
