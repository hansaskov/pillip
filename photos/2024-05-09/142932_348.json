    "Test": " The image shows a modern, stylish pendant light fixture with a unique design. It appears to be made of multiple white components that have been shaped and connected in a way that gives the impression of a flower or an abstract floral pattern. The lighting effect is such that it casts a soft glow from within its structure. This type of lighting would likely be used for decorative purposes, possibly in a modern home or commercial space to add visual interest and provide ambient illumination."
