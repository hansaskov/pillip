    "Test": " The image is blurry and the lighting is poor, but it appears to be taken indoors with a camera flash reflecting off something in the foreground. Due to the low resolution and quality of the photo, specific details are difficult to discern. It could be an object in motion or a scene with some activity happening at night or in low light conditions. The reflection on the surface suggests it might be a glass window or similar reflective material."
