    "Test": " The image shows a person holding what appears to be an electronic device, possibly a smartphone or a tablet. The screen of the device is facing the camera, but it's too blurry to see any content displayed on it. The lighting in the photo suggests indoor conditions, and the focus is not sharp, which makes it difficult to discern finer details."
