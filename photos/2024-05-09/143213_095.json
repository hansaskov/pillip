    "Test": " The image shows an interesting light fixture that resembles a flower. It is composed of multiple curved, translucent tubes or rods arranged in a circular pattern around a central point. This design creates a unique and eye-catching focal point. The light seems to be diffused through the structure, giving it an ethereal appearance."
