    "Test": " The image appears to be a composite of two different pictures placed side by side. On the left, there's an indistinct figure that seems to be holding a string of lights or possibly a necklace with round objects hanging from it, illuminated by the lights. On the right, there is a plain grey background which doesn't provide any additional context about the image. The overall composition of the image is unusual and doesn't convey a clear story or subject matter without more information."
