    "Test": " The image shows a hand holding what appears to be a circular object with multiple light bulbs. These lights are turned on, giving off a soft glow that casts shadows and creates an interesting pattern of illumination. It looks like a decorative item or possibly an artistic piece made from light bulbs arranged in a circular configuration, resembling a pendant lamp or a piece of interactive light art."
