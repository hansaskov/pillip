    "Test": " The image appears to be blurry and lacks clarity, but I can make out that it features a person taking a selfie. The individual seems to be indoors, possibly in an office or a public building with fluorescent lighting and what looks like a ventilation grate on the ceiling. The focus of the image is not sharp, which makes it challenging to provide more detailed information about the surroundings."
