    "Test": " The image shows the ceiling of an indoor space, likely a room or hallway. There is a square opening with a light fixture in it, and a black object that appears to be a clock hanging on the wall near the ceiling. The photo seems to have been taken from below, looking up at the ceiling and fixtures, which makes the clock appear as if it's floating or upside down due to perspective."
