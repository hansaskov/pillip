    "Test": " The image is quite blurry, but it appears to show a ceiling with some lighting fixtures or sprinkler heads. There's also a reflection of a light source in the photo that could be from a camera flash or another light source above the person taking the photo. Due to the low resolution and quality of the image, it's difficult to provide more specific details."
